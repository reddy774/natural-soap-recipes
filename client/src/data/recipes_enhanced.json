Pre-measure all ingredients, prepare your workspace with safety gear, and carefully make the lye solution by mixing sodium hydroxide into water and cooling it to about 120\u00b0F. Melt the solid oils on low heat, then combine with liquid oils in the slow cooker, bringing the mixture to around 120\u00b0F. Carefully add the lye solution to the oils, blend until reaching a medium trace (pudding-like consistency). Cook on low for 30-60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the soap resembles vaseline. Remove from heat, cool to just under 180\u00b0F, then stir in melted mango butter, essential oil, and yogurt. Pour into molds, let cool and harden for at least 12 hours, then cure for 4 weeks before use.\n**",

Weigh and melt solid fats (8 oz coconut oil, 6 oz palm oil, 2 oz shea butter).\n6. Pour melted solid fats into the liquid oils in the slow cooker and mix.\n7. Pour lye water slowly and carefully into the oil while stirring.\n8. Use a stick blender to stir until it reaches a thin pudding/gravy consistency (\"trace\").\n9. Set the slow cooker to \"low,\" put the lid on. Check after 15 minutes for separation and mix if needed.\n10. Check again in 20-30 minutes. The mixture will start to turn translucent from the edges inward.\n11. Stir the translucent mixture every 20-30 minutes. It will look like apple sauce. Mix in the floating glycerin layer.\n12. After 1.5 - 2 hours of cooking and stirring, the mixture will have a Vaseline-like consistency and is neutral. Turn off the slow cooker.\n13. Add 5-6 tbls of almond meal and 1 tbl of intense almond fragrance oil. Mix well.\n14. Scoop the soap into the mold, banging the mold to remove air pockets. Work quickly.\n15. Once cool and firm, remove from the mold and cut. The soap can be used immediately.",

      "instructions": "1. Start by melting your coconut oil. You can do this in the microwave or in a pan.\n2. Carefully measure the lye and water separately.\n3. Pour the water into a bowl or large glass jar. With gloves and eye protection, slowly add the lye to the water. NEVER ADD THE WATER TO THE LYE (this is really important). Stir carefully with a spoon, making sure not to let the liquid come in contact with your body directly.\n4. As you stir, this will create a cloudy white mixture that gets really hot. Let this mixture set for about 10 minutes to cool. It should become clear and not cloudy when it has cooled.\n5. When you have your melted coconut oil, pour it into a bowl and add the olive oil.\n6. Slowly pour in the water and lye mixture and stir.\n7. Quickly rinse the container used for the water and lye mixture out in the sink. I rinse well and then re-rinse with white vinegar to make sure all Lye has been neutralized.\n8. Use the metal or wooden spoon to stir the lye/water mixture into the oil mixture in.\n9. Once it is evenly mixed, use the immersion blender to blend for about 4-5 minutes or until it is opaque and starting to thicken.\n10. If you are going to use essential oils for scent, add them now.\n11. Quickly and carefully spoon into moulds. Any container will work, but I like loaf tins lined with parchment paper. I have included instructions for making one out of a box lined with parchment paper.\n12. Cover the moulds with parchment paper and set in a cool, dry place, away from kids and pets.\n13. After 24 hours, using gloves remove the soap from the moulds and cut into bars.\n14. Leave the bars somewhere to cure for about 4 weeks. You can test if they are done by sticking your tongue on them (yes this is really what you do) to see if the lye is still active. It will zing you like a battery if they aren\u2019t ready.",
