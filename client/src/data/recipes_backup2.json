Repeat the process of creating diagonal\nlines in the new section, but in the opposite\ndirection to the first lines, creating a\ncrisscross pattern.\n9. Continue alternating colors and creating\ndiagonal lines until the mold is filled.\n10. Allow the soap to cool and harden\ncompletely before removing it from the mold.\n11. Once removed, cut the soap along the\nlines to separate the tartan pattern into\nindividual bars.\nUseful Tips:\n- Work quickly when pouring and creating\nlines to prevent the soap from hardening too\nmuch.\n- Use rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle to\neliminate air bubbles that may form on the\nsurface of the soap.\n- Experiment with different color\ncombinations and patterns to create unique\ntartan designs.\n49. Mosaic - Small pieces of\ndifferent colors.\nMaterials and Tools Needed:\n- Soap base\n- Soap dyes or colorants in various colors\n- Soap molds\n- Knife or soap cutter\n- Cutting board\n- Microwave or double boiler\n- Stirring utensil\n- Rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle\n- Plastic wrap or parchment paper\nProcedure:\n1. Begin by preparing your soap base\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions.\nMelt the soap base using a microwave or\ndouble boiler.\n2. Once melted, separate the soap into smaller\ncontainers. Add soap dyes or colorants to\neach container to create different colored\nsoaps.\n3. Pour each colored soap into separate molds\nand allow them to harden completely.\n4. Once the soap has hardened, remove it\nfrom the molds and place it on a cutting\nboard.\n5. Using a knife or soap cutter, carefully cut\nthe colored soap into small pieces of varying\nshapes and sizes.\n6. Prepare your main soap mold by lining it\nwith plastic wrap or parchment paper.\n7. Arrange the small pieces of colored soap in\nthe main mold, creating a mosaic pattern.\nPress the pieces gently into the mold to secure\nthem in place.\n8. Melt any remaining clear soap base and\npour it over the mosaic pattern in the main\nmold. This will help bind the pieces together.\n9. Allow the soap to harden completely before\nremoving it from the mold.\n10. Once the soap has hardened, carefully\nremove it from the mold and cut it into bars\nor desired shapes.\n11. Allow the soap to cure for a few weeks\nbefore using it.\nUseful Tips:\n- Work quickly when arranging the mosaic\npieces, as the melted soap base can harden\nfast.\n- Use a variety of colors and shapes to create\na more intricate mosaic pattern.\n- Spray rubbing alcohol between layers of\nsoap to help them adhere together.\n- Experiment with different color\ncombinations and arrangements to create\nunique mosaic designs.\n50. Cosmic - Vibrant colors\nwith glitter for a cosmic effect.\nMaterials and Tools Needed:\n- Clear melt and pour soap base\n- Vibrant soap colorants (e.g., neon or cosmic\ncolors)\n- Biodegradable cosmetic glitter\n- Soap mold (with cosmic or star shapes, if\ndesired)\n- Microwave-safe measuring cup\n- Stirring utensil\n- Rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle (optional,\nfor removing air bubbles)\nProcedure:\n1. Cut the clear melt and pour soap base into\nsmall, uniform cubes and place them in a\nmicrowave-safe measuring cup.\n2. Microwave the soap base in short bursts,\nstirring in between, until completely melted.\n3. Add a few drops of vibrant soap colorants\nto the melted soap base and stir until the\ndesired color is achieved. Be careful not to\nadd too much colorant, as it can affect the\nsoap's ability to lather.\n4. Pour a thin layer of the colored soap into\nthe soap mold and allow it to cool and harden\nslightly. This will be the first layer of your\ncosmic design.\n5. Once the first layer has set, sprinkle a small\namount of biodegradable cosmetic glitter onto\nthe surface of the soap.\n6. Pour another layer of colored soap over the\nglitter and allow it to cool and harden slightly.\n7. Repeat the process of adding glitter and\npouring colored soap layers until the mold is\nfilled.\n8. Allow the soap to fully harden and cool\nbefore removing it from the mold.\n9. If desired, you can use rubbing alcohol in a\nspray bottle to remove any air bubbles that\nmay have formed in the soap while pouring\nthe layers.\nUseful Tips:\n- Experiment with different color\ncombinations and amounts of glitter to\nachieve the desired cosmic effect.\n- To create a more pronounced cosmic effect,\nconsider using a soap mold with cosmic or\nstar shapes.\n- Allow each layer of soap to cool and harden\nslightly before adding the next layer to\nprevent the colors from blending together.\n- Be mindful of the amount of glitter you use,\nas using too much can make the soap feel\ngritty.\n",

      "instructions": "*SCULPTING TOOL PREP:* First, you need to create the tool for the carrot shape. Cut a piece of sturdy cardboard into a \u201cT\u201d shape. Then, draw a carrot shape and cut it out. Ours ended up being about 2.5\u2033 long from the bottom of the carrot to the top. Keep in mind that the exact size and shape doesn\u2019t really matter. You can make it larger or smaller if you like. The top sides of the piece of cardboard will rest on top of either side of the mold. This will help keep the tool level throughout the process. If you\u2019d like, you can also include a \u201clip\u201d on the side (as seen in this tutorial). Because the carrot shape is less complicated and doesn\u2019t need to be as precise, we didn\u2019t include it. Once you\u2019re happy with the size and shape of the carrot, wrap it in clear packaging tape. This helps make it stronger and more \u201csoap-proof\u201d as it\u2019s moved throughout the mold.\\n\\n* MOLD & TOOL PREP:* Line the Tall Narrow Wood Loaf Mold with freezer paper with the shiny side up. For tips on how to line the mold, click here.\\n\\n* FRAGRANCE PREP:* Measure 2 ounces of Avocado Fragrance Oil into a small glass container and set aside. Measure 0.6 ounces of 10X Orange Essential Oil into a separate small glass container and set aside.\\n\\n* COLORANT PREP:* Disperse 1 teaspoon of the brown oxide into 1 tablespoon of sunflower or sweet almond oil (or any other liquid oil). Then disperse 1 teaspoon of Nuclear Orange Pigment into 1 tablespoon of lightweight liquid oil. Use a mini mixer to get rid of any clumps. Have 2 tablespoons of walnut shells and 2 teaspoons of orange peel powder nearby.\\n\\n* SAFETY FIRST:* Suit up for safe handling practices. That means goggles, gloves, and long sleeves. Make sure kids, pets, other distractions, and tripping hazards are out of the house or don\u2019t have access to your soaping space. Always soap in a well-ventilated area.\\n\\n* Slowly and carefully add 5.6 ounces of lye to 13.2 ounces of distilled water and gently stir until the lye has fully dissolved and the liquid is clear. Set aside to cool. If you\u2019d like a harder bar of soap that releases faster from the mold, you can add sodium lactate to the cooled lye water. Use 1 teaspoon of sodium lactate per pound of oils in the recipe. For this recipe, you\u2019d add 2.5 teaspoons sodium lactate.\\n\\n* Melt and combine 2 ounces of carrot seed oil, 1.2 ounces of castor oil, 2.4 ounces of deodorized cocoa butter, 10 ounces of coconut oil, 13.6 ounces of olive oil, and 10.8 ounces of palm oil (remember to fully melt then mix your entire container of palm oil before portioning) into a large mixing bowl.\\n\\n* Once the lye and water have cooled to about 130 degrees F, split off 10 ounces of the oil mixture into a separate container. Then, very carefully (with safety gear on), pour off 4.7 ounces of the lye solution into a separate container. Set these aside \u2013 they will be mixed together to form the carrot.\\n\\n* Slowly add the large batch of lye solution to the large batch of oils and stick blend until thin trace.\\n\\n* Add the 2 ounces of Avocado Fragrance Oil and use the stick blender to mix it in.\\n\\n* Add all of the dispersed brown oxide and 2 tablespoons of walnut shells. Use a whisk to mix them in thoroughly.\\n\\n* The soap should be a thin-medium trace. Give it a few pulses with the stick blender if it\u2019s still quite thin. Pour all of the brown soap into the Tall Narrow Wood Loaf Mold. Tap the mold firmly on the counter to get rid of bubbles.\\n\\n* Now, it\u2019s time to wait for the soap to firm and harden. The soap should be firm enough to hold its shape but thin enough to be scraped out smoothly. It\u2019s a little hard to know when you have that \u201cperfect\u201d texture. We tested every 3 minutes or so by scraping a small amount of the very top of the soap with the carrot tool. It\u2019s better to start scraping out the extra soap sooner rather than later. If the soap is not thick enough to hold any shape, let it harden for a few more minutes. But, if the soap is too thick, there is no going back. For this recipe, we found waiting about 8-10 minutes was the perfect amount of time to start carving out the carrot. Your soap may require more or less time, so keep an eye on it.\\n\\n* Once the soap is an appropriate texture, insert the cardboard carrot shape and begin pulling it through the mold. Place the extra soap into a separate mold to save it. The first few passes with the cardboard will be a little awkward and messy, but that\u2019s okay!\\n\\n* Continue sliding the tool through the mold. As you move the cardboard piece down the mold, lift it up and out and discard the excess soap. Continue to move the shaper down the length of the mold until you get about three-fourths of the way. Try your best to keep moving the carrot in the same spot over and over again, otherwise you\u2019ll end up with a very wide carrot.\\n\\n* Once you\u2019re almost to the other end, move the shaper in the opposite direction. Keep moving the carrot back and forth until it\u2019s no longer catching soap.\\n\\n* Once you\u2019re happy with the shape, it\u2019s time to mix the remaining lye and oils. Pour the lye mixture into the oils and stick blend until you reach a thin trace.\\n\\n* Add the 0.6 ounces of 10X Orange Essential Oil and mix in with the stick blender.\\n\\n* Add 1.5 teaspoons of dispersed Nuclear Orange Pigment and 2 teaspoons orange peel powder. Use a whisk to mix in.\\n\\n* Gently pour the orange soap into the negative space in the mold. Continue to pour until it\u2019s level with the top of the brown soap on the sides.\\n\\n* We had a little bit of orange soap leftover. We let it thicken slightly, and poured it down the middle of the orange layer to build it up in the center.\\n\\n* Use a small spoon to smooth out the orange soap and create a rounded top. Don\u2019t worry about it looking perfect. Set the soap aside while you prep the last batch.",

I made a video to walk you through it! The video tutorial for this soap also features a lot of details on how to calculate the soap and how to make it from start to finish.\\n\\nPut on your safety gear; gloves + eye protection of course, and an apron is also a good idea.\\n\\nPrepare your mould\u2014I used the loaf mould my dad made me for this soap, but you could use a cavity mould if you prefer.\\n\\nMelt your oils together in your soaping pot and let your oils cool to slightly warmer than room temperature. Mix up your lye water and let that cool to about room temperature (I always use ice for part of your water to speed up the cooling process).\\n\\nOnce the lye solution and the melted fats have cooled to slightly warmer than room temperature, you\u2019re ready to get started!\\n\\nBlend the kaolin clay into the fats, and stir the sodium lactate into the lye water. Gently pour the lye mixture to the melted fats. Bring the batter to a thin trace.

Pour the kaolin clay part of the batter into the loaf mould, and then knock the mold on your countertop to even it out and work out some of the bubbles.\\n\\nGently spoon the green batter on top of the uncoloured batter, smooth, and sculpt the top as desired. Once you\u2019ve sculpted the top (I did a bit of a mohawk with my spatula), leave it to saponify.\\n\\nAfter about 36 hours the soap should be firm enough to slice (though depending on your mould you may want to freeze it first\u2014I used a silicone mould and froze it to prevent denting, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d need to if you used a brittle mold that you can deconstruct to remove the loaf). Unmould it, trim off any dangly bits, and slice away.\\n\\nLeave the bars to age (aka dry) for 3\u20134 weeks before using. Enjoy!",

      "instructions": "Follow these steps to make your lye solution:\\n\\nSlowly add the lye to the water\\n\\n1.  Using your scale, take a heavy plastic, heat-resistant glass or stainless steel container and place it on the scale \u2013 thus giving you the weight of the container. (Use the same unit of measurement you used in the lye calculator \u2013 either ounces or grams)\\n2.  Once you have the weight of the empty container, press the \\\"tare\\\" button on your scale to return it to zero. You are now ready to measure your distilled water.\\n3.  SLOWLY pour the distilled water into the container on the scale until you reach your desired weight. Be accurate!\\n4.  Remove your water container from the scale and return the scale to zero (usually by hitting the \u201ctare\u201d button again)\\n5.  Place your sodium hydroxide container on the scale. Follow the same process you did for the water container, measuring the weight of the empty container first, then pressing \\\"tare\\\", to bring it back to zero.\\n6.  Next, take your sodium hydroxide and SLOWLY pour it into the container on the scale (You are wearing your gloves, right?) until you reach your desired weight.\\n7.  Next, in a well ventilated area, SLOWLY pour the sodium hydroxide into the water. **NOTE: Never pour water into sodium hydroxide!**\\n8.  Use your spatula to make sure the solution is well mixed. **Avoid breathing the fumes as much as possible.**\\n9.  The solution will heat up. Set aside and wait for it to cool to between 95\u00b0F and 105\u00b0F3.\\n\\nWhile the lye solution is cooling you can prepare your other ingredients and materials.\\n\\nChoose your fragrance (optional), color additives (optional) and/or any additives \\*\\*(link) that you will be incorporating. Get them out and set aside so they're ready.\\n\\nDuring this time, also prepare your mold.\\n\\nNext you need to combine your oils/fats in the soap pot. Depending on how many oils/fats you have, you may need to repeat these steps several times:\\n\\n1.  Place an appropriately sized container for the first oil/fat on the scale and weigh it. Press the \\\"tare\\\" button to return the scale to zero.\\n2.  Slowly either scoop (for solid oils/fats) or pour your oil into the container to the desired weight.\\n3.  Pour the measured oil/fat into your stainless steel soap pot\\n4.  Repeat #1 - #3 for each oil/fat you have in your recipe.\\n\\nIf your recipe contains solid oils/fats, you will need to melt them. Place your pot on a heat source (either a stove or a hot plate) and turn it on to medium heat. Do not leave your pot unattended! You do not want to overheat or burn the oils, only gently melt them. Stirring gently usually helps to break up the big pieces of solid oils and speed along the process.\\n\\nOnce the oils mixture is melted, turn off your burner to allow the oils to cool down between 95\u00b0F and 105\u00b0F4.\\n\\nWhile you are waiting for the oils and lye solution to cool, you can measure out your other ingredients. If you are not using fragrance, color or other additives, skip this step.\\n\\nFor each fragrance, color additive or other additive, place an appropriately sized container on the scale and weigh it. Press the \\\"tare\\\" button to return the scale to zero. Slowly pour/place your ingredient into the container until you reach the desired amount. Set aside.\\n\\nNOTE: As a general rule of thumb, don't use more than about 0.6 ounces of fragrance per 1 pound of oil/fat in your recipe.\\n\\nUse your digital thermometer to tell when your oil and lye solution have reached the desired temperature. Once they are ready, you can start the final phase (before the dishes, that is).\\n\\nMake sure you have everything ready at your work station - your mold, oils, lye solution, and fragrance and/or other additives. Plug in your stick blender and make sure you have your safety equipment on (put it back on, you know you took it off when you were waiting for things to cool down).\\n\\nBegin by pouring your lye solution slowly into your fats/oils and stirring with your whisk. Once all of the lye solution is in, scrape sides and stir with the spatula until everything is initially blended.\\n\\nIf you are using a stick blender, completely submerge it in the solution. If you used a big pot, you may have to tilt it to submerge the blender. Using short bursts, start to blend the solution, trying to get the edges and the bottom, completely mixing everything. Scrape down sides with the spatula to be sure no under mixed lye or oil remains.\\n\\nSLOWLY pour the lye solution into the oils\\n\\nUse a stick blender to mix the soap\\n\\nIf you're not using a stick blender, then just keep mixing and mixing by hand. It will work fine, but will take a while longer.\\n\\nThe solution will start to thicken as it saponifies (combines to become soap). Once it reaches \\\"trace\\\", you are ready to pour it into the soap mold. \\\"Trace\\\" is when the soap mixture is still thin enough to pour off a spoon, but thick enough to leave a \\\"trace\\\" on the top of the pot as it falls back in. It's about like cake batter.\\n\\nAdd any fragrance, color and/or other additives, using whisk or stick blender to incorporate fully.4\\n\\nTrace\\n\\nPour the soap into your mold\\n\\nSlowly pour the wet soap into the soap mold. Be sure to get all of the soap out of the pot, and get it into all of the corners of the mold. Once the pot is empty and your mold is filled, lightly tap the mold on the surface of your work station to make sure the soap is set and to release any trapped air. You can clean the edges of the soap mold if you wish, but it is not necessary.\\n\\nWrap or cover the mold with a heavy blanket or towel to contain the head and allow it to rest and cure for 12-24 hours. It will get quite warm and then cool down. That is the saponification process taking place. Once the soap is fully cooled, you can unmold it.\\n\\nDepending on your oils and water content, the soap may be soft when unmolded. Allow soap to rest until it is hardened up a bit (1 - 3 days) and then cut it as desired. Set aside in a cool area with good circulation for 4 - 6 weeks until the bars are fully hard.\\n\\nCongratulations! You just made your first batch of cold process soap!",
